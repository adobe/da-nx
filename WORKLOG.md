### AGENTS.md creation
Created AGENTS.md to capture conventions not derivable from the code. Key entries:
- `undefined` vs empty array for loading state detection
- `somethingUrl` (URL object) vs `href` (string) naming convention
- Avoid attaching custom properties to `window` (built-in browser APIs are fine)
- Error return shape (`{ error }` vs `{ json }`)
- Lazy loading with `firstUpdated` + null check pattern
- IIFE memoization pattern
- Functional style with companion utils

### Nav/sidenav semantic markup
Decided to wrap nav and sidenav in semantic HTML elements:
- `<header>` wraps `<nx-nav>`
- `<nav>` wraps `<nx-sidenav>` — gives `navigation` landmark for free
- header and nav are siblings in the DOM
- Skipping `aria-label` on `<nav>` unless multiple nav landmarks are needed

### AGENTS.md expanded
- Added Adobe Spectrum design language section — Nexter uses Spectrum *design* but not Spectrum libraries. Reference sites: express.adobe.com, experience.adobe.com.
- Added light/dark mode as a hard requirement with `light-dark()` CSS tip.
- Expanded lazy loading strategies: DOM-first hydrate-later, event-driven loading.
- Added iframe/customer code isolation convention (`setInterval` polling over `setTimeout`).
- Renamed "sidecar" utils to "companion" utils.

### CLAUDE.md & WORKLOG.md workflow
- Added `CLAUDE.md` instruction to read AGENTS.md for conventions.
- Added worklog trimming rule: delete git-recoverable info, condense completed work, keep open questions and key decisions.

### README.md updated
- Added "Context" section linking to AGENTS.md and WORKLOG.md with descriptions.

### nx2 `blocks/panel/` (app-frame side panels)
- Added `panel.js`: Lit `nx-panel` (shadow shell, default slot, resize handle in shadow), `createPanel` / `showPanel` (`{ width, beforeMain }`), `setPanelsGrid` for app-frame column/area CSS vars. Shell is `aside.panel` with `data-position` before/after main; `createPanel` / `showPanel` return the `nx-panel` element. Empty `aside` after removing `nx-panel` is dropped in `disconnectedCallback`.
- `decorate(block)`: if the block has an anchor → `loadFragment(a.href)` → `createPanel`, move fragment children onto `nx-panel` with DOM APIs, remove the block.
- Styling split: `styles.css` keeps app-frame grid (`--app-frame-*`, `body.app-frame` row); `panel.css` holds panel surface and resize affordance.
