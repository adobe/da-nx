# Icons

These icons have been gently changed from the Spectrum icon store. If you wish to add an icon, please reach out to the DA team.

You will have the most success adding to these icons if you supply a modified icon that has the following properties:

1. Has a correct XML tag at top of icon.
2. Has a `<g>` element with an ID.
3. Uses `fill="currentColor"` or `stroke="currentColor`.
